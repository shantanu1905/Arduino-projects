# ardino-projects
Basic things you need to use arduino are:

Basic c+ language.

Arduino ide available in the arduino website (download link https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)

An Arduino board.

Some basic electonic knowledge.

Arduino ide it self contains some examples which helps you to learn the programming it.

And mostly used sensors that's it.


#setting up aurdino IDE:

                step1: connect the ardino board with pc with the of cable provided for connecting ardino.
